# Classification Challenge

This activity used a dataset on emails where it makes classifications on spam emails by `0` or `1`. Two different models - Logistic Regression Model and Random Forest Model - were used to fit the data. Standard Scaler was used as well to scale the features before creating the models.


### Conclusion

Logistic Regression Model had an accuracy score of `0.9278887923544744` while Random Forest Classifier Model had an accuracy score of `0.9669852302345786`. We can see that Random Forest Classifier performed better for our dataset.
